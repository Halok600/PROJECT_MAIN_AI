/**
 * Eval cases mirroring SPEC.md §5's concrete target queries. Kept as the
 * actual concrete versions already verified manually earlier in JOURNAL.md
 * (e.g. "[X]" → "Nirmit from SkillLayer") so results are directly
 * comparable to that prior manual verification, not just a fresh unrelated
 * check.
 *
 * Reviewed by an independent subagent (JOURNAL.md 2026-08-05) which found
 * real gaps, now fixed: the recency-based Tier1 #2 query wasn't tested at
 * all (see tier1-drive-recency below — added, and its honest limitation
 * documented rather than hidden), the Tier2 #1 query was silently narrowed
 * to one named company (now disclosed instead of silent), a not_found case
 * under-specified which tools were required, and two keyword checks were
 * loose enough to pass on a wrong answer (now require an actual citation
 * link, not just the topic word).
